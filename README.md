## Overview

The idea of this exercise was to make a component that would take a text area and listen for the event 'onion'. When this event was triggered, the component should return the string 'I HATE ONIONS'


## My process

Taking into account what was taught in class, I applied the concepts of listeners to make this exercise possible

### Built with

- JavaScript ES6
- Vite
- React

### What I learned

This exercise served as a great reminder of the different event listeners we have available.
